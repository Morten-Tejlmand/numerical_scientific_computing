## Numerical Scientific Computing — Mandelbrot (Week 1)

Week 1 goals:

- Setup reproducible Python environment using uv
- Initialize git repo + push to GitHub
- Implement naive Mandelbrot baseline + timing

## Run baseline

There is two function in main, that have to be run to create and time, and one to visualize it

```bash
python main.py
```

remember to run this before handing in, to generate requirement.txt file
uv export --format requirements-txt > requirements.txt
